# (Somewhat an) Idle Game Made in Python

So one day i was bored and shit and the idea came to me in a dream. Js sucks, web app sucks, so i make it with tkinter as frontend

## How to run
As i said before this shit uses tkinter as a frontend so if you want to use it you need to install python and tkinter first. then just run the game.py
